Health concerns often don't follow a schedule, and may knock at the door anytime and anywhere. But early detection and proper medication can prevent these concerns from becoming severe problems. Letâ€™s understand this with the help of an example- Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder common in aged people that affects movement. It develops gradually, sometimes starting with a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand. While tremors are common, the disorder also commonly causes stiffness or slowing of movement. Parkinson's disease symptoms worsen as your condition progresses over time and there is no cure for this. But it can be cured if it is detected at an early stage.
